title: "Bash Primer"
summary: "Quick primer to the BASH programming language"
tags: ["blog"]
---

I feel like writing Bash is like building something with hot glue.
When you try it for the first time, you'll probably make a big mess and burn yourself.
As you use it a bit more, you can slap things together really quickly but the end result won't be very sturdy or pretty.

The goal of this guide is to serve as a quick primer to writing scripts in Bash, as well as sharing a handful of style tips and pitfalls.
However, the biggest piece of advice I can give about Bash is to write as little of it as possible.
The syntax is often unintuitive and scripts written in Bash tend to be fairly brittle.
Here's my favorite line from Google's [shell style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml):
> Shell should only be used for small utilities or simple wrapper scripts.

I hope this guide helps you write readable, robust, and short Bash scripts.
If you find yourself writing longer scripts or needing the more advanced features of Bash, please consider reaching for a stronger scripting language like Ruby or Python.
Your team mates and future self will thank you.

## Hello world<a name="hello-world"></a>

1. Create a file called `hello-world` with the following contents

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
```

> **Note:** All bash scripts should start with a bash header. `#!/bin/bash` is the most common, although `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is also used.

2. Make it executable

```
chmod +x ./hello-world
```
> **Note:** Notice that the script does not have the `.sh` extension.
Omitting the extension makes it easier to replace the script with a script or
executable written in another language later on.

3. Run it

```
./hello-world
```
You should see `Hello, World!` printed in your terminal.

## The basics<a name="the-basics"></a>

Printing to the terminal:

```
# write to stdout
echo "Hello, world!"

# write to stderr
echo "Something went wrong..." >&2
```

Declaring variables:

```
# integers
count=10

# strings
message="Installing dependencies..."

# BAD: bash does not support floats
bad_var=1.1
```
> **Style Tip:** local variable names should use lowercase letters and underscores

Accessing variables:

```
welcome_message="Hello!"

echo "Welcome message: ${welcome_message}" # prints 'Welcome message: Hello!'
```
> **Style Tip:** I prefer using the `${}` syntax for accessing variables as it allows for parameter substitution and avoids string interpolation edge cases.

Integer Arithmetic:

```
echo "$((2+2))" # prints 4
a=1
(( a++ )) # sets `a` to 2
echo "$(( a++ ))" # still prints 2, then sets value to 3.
                  # Be careful with pre vs post increment!
```

Create arrays of values:

```
# Note that values are space delimited instead of commas unlike most languages
values=( 1 2 3 4 ) # initialize array of integers
strings=( "foo" "bar" "asdf" ) # or strings

echo "${values[0]}" # prints first value in array, "1"
echo "${#values[@]} # prints length of array, "4"
```

If statements:

```
if [[ <some_condition> ]]; then
  command0
elif [[ <another_condition> ]]; then
  command1
else
  command2
fi
```

Test operators:

```
# integers
if [[ "$a" -eq "$b" ]] # equal
if [[ "$a" -ne "$b" ]] # not equal
if [[ "$a" -gt "$b" ]] # greater than
if [[ "$a" -lt "$b" ]] # less than

# strings
if [[ "$a" == "$b" ]]
if [[ "$a" != "$b" ]]

# variables
if [[ -z "$1" ]] # succeeds if $1 is unset
if [[ -n "$1" ]] # succeeds if $1 is set

# boolean operators
if [[ ! <condition> ]] # invert result
if [[ <condition0> ]] && [[ <condition1> ]] # and
if [[ <condition0> ]] || [[ <condition1> ]] # or

## file operators
if [[ -e "${file}" ]] # true if file or directory exists
if [[ -f "${file}" ]] # true if file exists, false for directories
if [[ -d "${dir}" ]] # true if directory exists, false for files
```

For loops:

```
# print 1 through 10 inclusive
for i in $(seq 1 10); do # be sure not to quote "$(...)"
  echo "${i}"
done

# iterate over values in array
for i in "${values[@]}"; do
  echo "${i}"
done
```

Iterate over lines in a file:

```
while read line; do
  echo "${line}"
done < input.txt
```

Case statements:

```
case "$1" in

  start)
    echo "Starting..."
    ;;

  stop | shutdown)
    echo "Stopping..."
    ;;

  *)
    # default case
    echo "ERROR: Unrecognized option $1"
    echo "Usage: my_script {start|stop|shutdown}"
    ;;
esac
```

Create functions:

```
pretty_print() { # 'function' keyword is optional, omitting it is more portable
  echo "****** $1 ******"
}

result="$(pretty_print "hello world!")"
```
> **Note:** there is no `return` keyword, only writing to stdout/err

## Inputs, outputs, and redirection<a name="inputs-outputs-and-redirection"></a>

Redirecting program output to stdout and stderr:

```
# write stdout to file (overrides exists content)
happy_command > stdout.log

# write stderr to file
sad_command 2> stderr.log

# write both stdout and stderr to file
mixed_command &> combined.log

# add additional `>` to redirections to append rather than override
happy_again >> stdout.log
```

Piping the output of one command as input to another:

```
# prints line containing the word "ERROR"
cat debug.log | grep "ERROR"

# pretty print JSON response from API
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://my-api/users | jq '.'

# Sort directories by size
du -h | sort -rh
```

Assign output of command to variable:

```
# simple
output="$(echo 'hello!')"

# more complex
first_user_id="$(curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://my-api/users | jq -r '.users[0].id')"
```

## Script arguments<a name="arguments"></a>

Positional Arguments:

```
# Usage
./my-script hello world

echo "$0" # ./test, script path
echo "$1" # hello, first positional arg
echo "$2" # world, second arg

echo "$#" # 2, total number of args
echo "$*" # "hello world", expands all args as a single word
echo "$@" # "hello" "world", expands all args as separate words

# shift
echo "$1" # hello
shift # discard first arg, slide remaining args to left
echo "$1" # world

# print each arg
for arg in "$@"; do
  echo "$arg"
done
```

Environment variables + Parameter substitution:

```
# Usage
MY_VAR="some-value" ANOTHER_VAR=1 ./my-script

# declare a required environment variable
: ${REQUIRED_VAR:?} # will throw an error if variable is not set

# declare an optional environment variable
: ${OPTIONAL_VAR:=} # sets OPTIONAL_VAR to empty string if unset

# declare an optional environment variable with a default value
: ${OPTIONAL_VAR:=default_value} # sets OPTIONAL_VAR to `default_value` if unset

# make variable available to child processes
export MY_VAR
./my-child-script

# assign default value to positional arg
arg="${1:-default_value}" # sets `arg` to first positional arg if set, `default_value` otherwise
```

> **Note:** The leading `:` prevents bash from running the variable contents as a command

> **Style Tip:** I find it helpful to use ALL CAPS to indicate variable that are passed in from the environment.

Command line flags:

```
# invoke script with ./my_script -p foo -c bar
while getopts "c:p:" opt; do
  case "${opt}" in
    c)
      c_value="$OPTARG"
      ;;
    p)
      p_value="$OPTARG"
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Unknown argument: ${opt}"
      ;;
  esac
done
```

## Files and directories<a name="files-and-directories"></a>

View and edit files:

```
# view, but not change a file
less output.log

# a powerful file editor with a bit of a learning curve...
vim my-script
```

Filepath operations:

```
basename "/path/to/file.txt" # prints "file.txt"
dirname "/path/to/file.txt" # prints "/path/to/"
```

Create temporary files:

```
# Create a directory in /tmp
# 'XXXXX' will be replaced with random characters
tmpdir="$(mktemp -d /tmp/my-project.XXXXX)"

trap '{ rm -rf ${tmpdir}; }' EXIT # remove tmpdir on script exit
```

Changing directories (the nice way):

```
# GOOD
pushd "${workspace}" # changes working dir to ${workspace}
  # do some work
popd # changes working dir back to original value

# BAD, forgetting to reset user's working dir...
cd "${workspace}"
# do some work
exit 0
```

Extract file or directory names:

```
file_path=/home/foo/my-file.txt

file="$(basename ${file_path})" # "my-file.txt"
dir="$(dirname ${file_path})" # "/home/foo"
```

Find and delete files by name:

```
# recursively finds all files and directories named 'test' under /some/dir
find /some/dir -name "test"

# recursively find all txt files under current directory
find . -name "*.txt" -type f

# delete all .tmp files
find . -name "*.tmp" -type f -delete
# or
find . -name "*.tmp" -type f | xargs rm
```

Archive and Extract files:

```
# Create archive of all files in current directory in
# tar format, compressed with gzip
tar czvf my_files.tgz ./*

# Extract to given directory
tar xvf my_files.tgz -C /some/output/dir
```

Sourcing utility functions from other files:

```
# ./utils.sh
pretty_print() {
  # do work
}

# ./my_script
source ./utils.sh

pretty_print "hello world!"
```
> **Note:** The `.sh` extension is useful for indicating files that should be sourced

## Processes<a name="processes"></a>

Get the previous command's exit code:

```
set -e # Exit if any command exits non-zero

# do some setup

set +e # temporarily allow commands to exit non-zero
failing_command
exit_code="$?" # returns exit code of the previous command
set -e

if [[ "${exit_code}" -eq 0 ]]; then
  echo "Failed to do something. Exiting..." >&2
  # do some cleanup
  exit 1
fi
```

Make a command non-interactive:

```
yes | rm ./*.txt # equivalent to `rm -f *.txt`
```

Determine OS:

```
platform="$( uname -s )"
case "${platform}" in
  Linux)
    echo "Linux"
    ;;
  Darwin)
    echo "Mac"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Something else"
    ;;
esac
```

Run commands in sequence:

```
# stops if command exits non-zero
mkdir tmp && do-work && rm -r tmp

# stops if command exits zero
update-file || create-file

# run all commands regardless of exit value
do-work ; cat output.log
```

Capture PID and write to file:

```
pidfile=/path/to/process.pid

# replace current process with another process, writing process ID to a file
echo $$ > ${pidfile}
exec some_process

# launch process in the background, writing background process ID to a file
some_process &
echo $! > ${pidfile}
```

Generate timestamps (useful for logging):

```
date +%Y-%m-%d # prints "2016-01-10"

date +%F # same result, shorthand for "+%Y-%m-%d"

date +%s # prints "1452484369", seconds since Epoch
         # useful for generating "unique" filenames
```

## HTTP utilities<a name="http-utilities"></a>

Download a file:

```
# saves escape_artist.png in working dir
wget https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/escape_artist.png

# saves file at given path
wget http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/escape_artist.png -O /tmp/xkcd.png

# save as remote filename rather than name in URL
wget --content-disposition https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3177
```

Send HTTP requests:

```
# GET request with verbose output and follows redirects
curl -vL google.com

# post JSON data
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"key": "value"}' localhost:8080
```

## Text processing<a name="text-processing"></a>

Print a multi-line string using a heredoc:

```
cat <<EOF
Usage:
  ./my-script hello world
EOF
```
> **Note:** `EOF` can be any unique delimiter.

Save heredoc to variable:

```
result="$(cat <<EOF
some
multi-line
text
EOF)"
```

Write a heredoc to a file:

```
cat > some-file.txt <<EOF
your
  file
    contents
      here
EOF
```

Print the n-th item in a line:

```
words="this is only a test"
echo "${words}" | cut -d ' ' -f3 # prints "only", index starts at 1
echo "${words}" | cut -d ' ' -f1-3 # prints "this is only"
echo "${words}" | cut -d ' ' -f1,f5 # prints "this test"

csv="first,last,address"
echo "${csv}" | cut -d ',' -f2 # prints "last", changes delimiter
```

Replace characters in string:

```
csv="first,last,address"

# bash built-in, `//` replaces all occurrences, a single `/` replaces the first
echo "${csv//,/_}" # outputs "first_last_address"

# sed, supports file operations as well
echo "${csv}" | sed 's/,/_/g' # prints "first_last_address"
```

Remove lines matching a pattern:

```
sed '/DEBUG/d` debug.log # prints file with lines containing DEBUG removed
sed -i '/^\s*$/d' output.txt # remove empty lines from file, overriding in-place
```

Get leading or trailing lines in file:

```
head -n1 ./some_file # prints first line in file
tail -n1 ./some_file # prints last line in file
tail -f ./process.log # streams file contents as new lines are added, useful for debugging
```

Counting things:

```
wc -w ./some-file # prints word count
wc -l ./some-file # line count
wc -m ./some-file # char count

echo "${output}" | wc -w # also accepts stdin
```

Searching for text:

```
# print lines matching pattern
grep 'foo' ./some-file
grep -i 'fOo' ./some-file # case insensitive
grep -v 'bar' ./some-file # inverse, print lines not matching regex
grep 'fo\+' ./some-file # regex, use egrep for better regex support
echo "${var}" | grep 'foo' # can be used with pipes

# check for running process name
ps aux | grep mysql
```

Using regex in conditionals:

```
regex='[[:digit:]]{1,3}\.[[:digit:]]{1,3}\.[[:digit:]]{1,3}\.[[:digit:]]{1,3}'
if [[ "10.10.0.255" =~ ${regex} ]]; then # do not surround regex variable in quotes
  echo "Match!"
else
  echo "No match..."
fi

# capture groups
regex='[a-z]+_([a-z]+)' # capture letters following `_`
[[ "first_last" =~ ${regex} ]]
last_name="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}" # [0] is the full match, [1] is the first capture group
```
> **Notes:**
- Uses POSIX regex, e.g. `[[:digit:]]` instead of `\d`
- To avoid unexpected behavior, always store regex in a variable and
  do not quote the variable after the `=~` operator.

## Patterns I like<a name="patterns-i-like"></a>

Setting reasonable default options:

```
# exit immediately if a command exits non-zero
set -e

# treat unset variables as errors
set -u

# prints commands as they are executed
# Nice for logging in prod/CI environments, but probably omit if your script is
# intended to be run by humans
set -x

# sets return value of pipeline to non-zero if any command returns non-zero
set -o pipefail

# one-liner
set -eux -o pipefail
```

Allow your script to be called from any working directory:

```
# get the absolute location of this script
my_dir="$( cd "$( dirname "$0" )" && pwd )"

# assumes my_dir is one level below project_dir
project_dir="$( cd "${my_dir}/.." && pwd )"

pushd "${project_dir}"
  cat ./data/config.yml
  ./scripts/other_script
popd
```

Boilerplate file template:

```
#!/bin/bash

set -eux -o pipefail

my_dir="$( cd "$( dirname "$0" )" && pwd )"
project_dir="$( cd "${my_dir}/.." && pwd )"

: ${REQUIRED_VAR:?}
: ${OPTIONAL_VAR:=}
: ${DEFAULT_VAR:=default-value}

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## Pitfalls<a name="pitfalls"></a>

Forgetting to make script executable:

```
# BAD
echo "${script_contents}" > ./my-script
./my-script # prints "bash: ./my-script: Permission denied"

# GOOD
chmod +x ./my-script
./my-script # runs as expected
```

Misusing lexical comparison operators (`>` and `<`) for integer comparisons:

```
# BAD
[[ 5 > 10 ]] # evaluates to true since 5 is alphabetically greater than 1

# GOOD
[[ 5 -gt 10 ]] # evaluates to false as expected
```

Adding whitespace around variable assignment and conditionals:

```
# BAD
val = "some value" # attempts to run val as a command, prints "No command 'val' found"

# GOOD
val="some value" # performs variable assignment as expected

# BAD
[[1 -eq 1]] # syntax error, "[[1: command not found"

# GOOD
[[ 1 -eq 1 ]] # performs comparison as expected
```

Using pipes without `set -o pipefail`:

```
# BAD
set -e # only considers the exit code of the last command run in a pipeline

curl http://example.comm | tee output.txt # curl exits non-zero, but tee exits 0
echo "continuing..."                      # bash continues to run the rest of the script

# GOOD
set -e -o pipefail # sets pipeline exit-code to non-zero if any command exits non-zero

curl http://example.comm | tee output.txt # curl fails, script exits as expected
echo "continuing..." # not executed
```

Leaving variables unquoted:

```
# use quotes to prevent word splitting
tmp_dir="/home/my stuff/tmp" # note the space in filepath

# BAD
rm -rf ${my_dir} # lack of quotes causes to args to be pass '/home/my' and 'stuff/tmp'

# GOOD
rm -rf "${my_dir}" # quotes ensure variable is passed as a single arg

# use quotes to handle empty vars
ENV_VAR=""

# BAD
[[ -z ${ENV_VAR} ]] # expands to [[ -z ]], returns syntax error

# GOOD
[[ -z "${ENV_VAR}" ]] # expands to [[ -z "" ]], no syntax error
```

Passing a potentially empty variable to `rm -rf`:

```
# caller forgets to set OUTPUT_DIR

# BAD
rm -rf "${OUTPUT_DIR}/*" # expands to 'rm -rf /*', yikes

# GOOD
: ${OUTPUT_DIR:?} # script exits if OUTPUT_DIR is unset
rm -rf "${OUTPUT_DIR}/*"
```
> **Note:** [Here](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2871653/scary-steam-for-linux-bug-erases-all-the-personal-files-on-your-pc.html) is an example of this pitfall in action.

Using `~` in scripts:

```
# BAD
home_dir="~" # ~ does not expand when quoted

# GOOD
home_dir="${HOME}" # expands as expected
```
